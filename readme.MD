This project aims to reproduce a tool like geogebra on a small defined portion of the plane. It will be used in the https://github.com/lfa-info-22/site project

# Using the calculator

You can use the calculator by create a GeometryCanvas using the new method and by attaching a container to it. You can then generate the axis like in index.html by using generateAxis. And you can then start using the calculator to draw strict inequalities (<) and strict equalities (==)
